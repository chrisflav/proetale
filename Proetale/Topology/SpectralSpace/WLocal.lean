# w-local spaces

In this file we define w-local spaces. These are spectral spaces in which every point
specializes to a unique closed point and where the set of closed points is closed.
-/

/--
A spectral space is w-local if every point specializes to a unique closed point
and the set of closed points is closed.
Note: In a spectral space, every point specializes to a closed point, so we only require
the uniqueness.
