\chapter{Local structure}

This chapter serves for the commutative algebra preparation of the remaining part of the paper. The key results are
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \Cref{thm:ind-etale-w-contractible-cover-exists} expressing that every affine scheme has a w-contractible cover in the proetale site.
  \item \Cref{thm:weakly-etale-ind-etale} expressing that every weakly etale map can be covered by ind-etale maps.
\end{enumerate}

% Question: Can we avoid using weakly etale algebra, only use ind-etale algebra? This would need a modification of theorem 5.4.2, by directly mimicking the proof of topological invariance of étale sites for weakly étale.
% If so, we can remove theorem \Cref{thm:weakly-etale-ind-etale} and every dependency of it.

\begin{definition}[Extremally disconnected space]

  A topological space \(X\) is \emph{extremally disconnected} if the closure of every open subset is open.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} [Stone-Čech compactification]
  \label{def:stone-cech-compactification}
  \lean{StoneCech}
  \mathlibok

  Let \(X\) be a topological space. The \emph{Stone-Čech compactification} of \(X\) is the
  profinite space \(\beta(X)\) such that
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \(X\) is dense in \(\beta(X)\);
    \item every continuous map \(f: X \to Y\) to a compact Hausdorff space \(Y\)
        extends uniquely to a continuous map \(\beta(f): \beta(X) \to Y\).
  \end{enumerate}
  We denote the Stone-Čech compactification of \(X\) by \(\beta(X)\).
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/090D}{Tag 090D}]{stacks-project}}]
  Let $X$ be a quasi-compact Hausdorff space. There exists a continuous surjection $X' \to X$ with $X'$ quasi-compact, Hausdorff, and extremally disconnected.

  \uses{def:extremally-disconnected, def:stone-cech-compactification}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{thm:stone-cech-extremally-disconnected}
  Let $Y=X$ but endowed with the discrete topology. Let $X'=\beta (Y)$, which is extremally disconnected by \Cref{thm:stone-cech-extremally-disconnected}. The continuous map $Y \to X$ factors as $Y \to X' \to X$.

\section{w-contractible rings}

\begin{definition}[w-contractible rings, {\cite[Definition 2.4.1]{proetale}}]
A ring \(A\) is \emph{w-contractible} if every faithfully flat ind-étale map \(A \to B\) has a retraction.
  \label{def:w-contractible-ring}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{thm:w-contractible-if-ind-etale-plus-c-has-retraction}
  \uses{def:w-local-ring,def:ind-etale,def:w-contractible-ring}
  Let \(A\) be a w-local ring and $I \subset A$ the Jacobson radical cutting out the set $X^c$ of closed points in $X = \Spec (A)$. If every faithfully flat ind-étale map \(A \to B\) with \(B\) w-local and whose closed points of \(\Spec (B)\) are exactly \(V(IB)\) has a retraction, then \(A\) is w-strictly contractible.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{thm:closed-points-isom-w-local,thm:ind-Zariski-is-flat-ind-etale,thm:ind-etale-comp}
  Let $A \to B$ be faithfully flat and ind-étale. 
  % We will use without further mention the fact that a flat map $A \to B$ is faithfully flat if and only if every closed point of $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is in the image of $\operatorname{Spec}(B) \to \operatorname{Spec}(A)$. 
  We will show that $A \to B$ has a retraction.

  We may replace $B$ by the ring $C$ constructed in \Cref{thm:closed-points-isom-w-local} for $A \to B$ and $I \subset A$. To justify this, note that by \Cref{thm:ind-Zariski-is-flat-ind-etale}, the map \( B \to C \) is flat and ind-étale. It is faithfully flat by \Cref{item:quotinet-isom-closed-points-isom-w-local} in \Cref{thm:closed-points-isom-w-local}, since the closed points of \( \Spec(B) \) lie in the image of \( \Spec(C) \to \Spec(B) \). Therefore, by \Cref{thm:ind-etale-comp}, the composition \( A \to C \) is also faithfully flat and ind-étale. Hence, we may assume $\Spec (B)$ is w-local such that the set of closed points of $\Spec (B)$ is $V(IB)$ by \Cref{item:w-local-closed-points-isom-w-local,item:inverse-image-closed-points-isom-w-local} in \Cref{thm:closed-points-isom-w-local}.

  \label{thm:ind-etale-plus-c-has-retraction-if}

    \item $A$ is w-strictly local, and \label{item:w-strictly-local-ind-etale-plus-c-has-retraction-if}
    \item $\pi_0(\Spec (A))$ is extremally disconnected. \label{item:extremally-disconnected-ind-etale-plus-c-has-retraction-if}
  \end{enumerate}
  then every faithfully flat ind-étale map \(A \to B\) with \(B\) w-local and whose closed points of \(\Spec (B)\) are exactly \(V(IB)\) has a retraction. Here $I \subset A$ is the Jacobson radical of $A$ cutting out the set $X^c$ of closed points in $X = \Spec (A)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{thm:ind-etale-base-change,thm:ind-etale-strictly-henselian-identifies-local-rings,thm:ff-identifies-local-rings-has-retraction-if}
  Let \(A \to B\) be a faithfully flat ind-étale map with \(B\) w-local and whose closed points of \(\Spec (B)\) are exactly \(V(IB)\). In this case $A \to B$ identifies local rings, it suffices to check this at maximal ideals of $B$ which lie over maximal ideals of $A$. By \Cref{item:w-strictly-local-ind-etale-plus-c-has-retraction-if}, we know that the local rings of $A$ at its maximal ideal $\m$ are strictly henselian. By \Cref{thm:ind-etale-base-change} and \Cref{thm:ind-etale-strictly-henselian-identifies-local-rings}.
  Thus $A \to B$ has a retraction by \Cref{thm:ff-identifies-local-rings-has-retraction-if}.

  Choose an extremally disconnected space $T$ and a surjective continuous map $T \to \pi_0(\operatorname{Spec}(C))$ by \Cref{thm:extremally-disconnected-cover}. Note that $T$ is profinite.
  Apply \Cref{thm:exists-ind-Zariski-cartesian} to find an ind-Zariski ring map $C \to D$ such that $\pi_0(\Spec (D)) \to \pi_0(\Spec (C))$ realizes $T \to \pi_0(\Spec (C))$ and such that
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}

  \]
  is cartesian in the category of topological spaces.

  Following \Cref{thm:cartesian-w-local}, we note that $\Spec (D)$ is w-local, that $\Spec (D) \to \Spec (C)$ is w-local, and that the set of closed points of $\Spec (D)$ is the inverse image of the set of closed points of $\Spec (C)$.

  Thus it is still true that the local rings of $D$ at its maximal ideals are strictly henselian (as they are isomorphic to the local rings at the corresponding maximal ideals of $C$ by \Cref{thm:ind-Zariski-identifies-local-rings}). It follows from \Cref{thm:w-contractible-if} that $D$ is w-contractible.
