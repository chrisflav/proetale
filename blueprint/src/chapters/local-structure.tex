\chapter{Local structure}

This chapter serves for the commutative algebra preparation of the remaining part of the paper. The key results are
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \Cref{thm:ind-etale-w-contractible-cover-exists} expressing that every affine scheme has a w-contractible cover in the proetale site.
  \item \Cref{thm:weakly-etale-ind-etale} expressing that every weakly etale map can be covered by ind-etale maps.
\end{enumerate}

% Question: Can we avoid using weakly etale algebra, only use ind-etale algebra? This would need a modification of theorem 5.4.2, by directly mimicking the proof of topological invariance of étale sites for weakly étale.
% If so, we can remove theorem \Cref{thm:weakly-etale-ind-etale} and every dependency of it.

\begin{definition}[Extremally disconnected space]
  \label{def:extremally-disconnected}
  \lean{ExtremallyDisconnected}
  \mathlibok

  A topological space \(X\) is \emph{extremally disconnected} if the closure of every open subset is open.
\end{definition}

The reason that we are interested in extremally disconnected space is the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:extremally-disconnected-projective}
  \uses{def:extremally-disconnected}
  \lean{CompHaus.toStonean,Stonean.instProjectiveCompHausCompHaus}
  \mathlibok
  Let \(X\) be a quasi-compact Hausdorff topological space. Then \(X\) is extremally disconnected if and only if it is a projective object in the category of quasi-compact Hausdorff spaces, i.e., for every continuous surjection \(f : Y \to Z\) of quasi-compact Hausdorff spaces and every continuous map \(g : X \to Z\), there exists a continuous map \(h : X \to Y\) such that \(f \circ h = g\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition} [Stone-Čech compactification]
  \label{def:stone-cech-compactification}
  \lean{StoneCech}
  \mathlibok

  Let \(X\) be a topological space. The \emph{Stone-Čech compactification} of \(X\) is the
  profinite space \(\beta(X)\) such that
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \(X\) is dense in \(\beta(X)\);
    \item every continuous map \(f: X \to Y\) to a quasi-compact Hausdorff space \(Y\)
        extends uniquely to a continuous map \(\beta(f): \beta(X) \to Y\).
  \end{enumerate}
  We denote the Stone-Čech compactification of \(X\) by \(\beta(X)\).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    Let \(X\) be a topological space. Then the Stone-Čech compactification \(\beta(X)\) is extremally disconnected.
    \label{thm:stone-cech-extremally-disconnected}
    \uses{def:extremally-disconnected, def:stone-cech-compactification}
    \lean{StoneCech.projective}
    \mathlibok
\end{theorem}

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/090D}{Tag 090D}]{stacks-project}}]
  Let $X$ be a quasi-compact Hausdorff space. There exists a continuous surjection $X' \to X$ with $X'$ quasi-compact, Hausdorff, and extremally disconnected.
  \label{thm:extremally-disconnected-cover}
  \uses{def:extremally-disconnected, def:stone-cech-compactification}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{thm:stone-cech-extremally-disconnected}
  Let $Y=X$ but endowed with the discrete topology. Let $X'=\beta (Y)$, which is extremally disconnected by \Cref{thm:stone-cech-extremally-disconnected}. The continuous map $Y \to X$ factors as $Y \to X' \to X$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $X = \lim_i X_i$ be a cofiltered limit of topological spaces and let
    $x \in X$ be an element. Denote by $x_i$ the image of $x$ in $X_i$. Then
    $\overline{\{x\}} = \lim_i \overline{\{x_i\}}$.
    \label{lemma:closure-limit}
\end{lemma}

The following pure topological lemmas will be used in \Cref{thm:colim-open-closed-localizations-surj-ind-zariski,thm:cartesian-profinite-w-local}.

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/08ZL}{Tag 08ZL}]{stacks-project}}]
  \label{thm:pi0-to-totally-disconnected}
  Let \(X\) be a topological space. Let \(\pi_0(X)\) be the set of connected components of \(X\). Let \(X \to \pi_0(X)\) be the map which sends \(x \in X\) to the connected component of \(X\) passing through \(x\). Endow \(\pi_0(X)\) with the quotient topology. Then %\(\pi_0(X)\) is a totally disconnected space and 
  any continuous map \(X \to Y\) from \(X\) to a totally disconnected space \(Y\) factors through \(\pi_0(X)\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Since connected subsets are mapped to connected subsets and the connected components of a totally disconnected space are singletons, any continuous map \(X \to Y\) sends each connected component of \(X\) to a single point in \(Y\). Thus, it factors uniquely through \(\pi_0(X)\).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{thm:pi0-to-totally-disconnected-injective}
  \uses{thm:pi0-to-totally-disconnected}
  Let \(X\) be a topological space. Let \(\pi_0(X)\) be the topological space of connected components of \(X\). Let \(Y\) be a totally disconnected space. If every fiber of \(X \to Y\) is connected, then the map \(\pi_0(X) \to Y\) is injective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/005F}{Tag 005F}]{stacks-project}}]
  \label{thm:connected-component-intersection-closed-open}
  Let $X$ be a topological space. Assume $X$ is quasi-compact, quasi-separated
  and prespectral. Then for any $x \in X$ the connected component of $X$ containing $x$ is
  the intersection of all open and closed subsets of $X$ containing $x$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $T$ be the connected component containing $x$. Let $S = \bigcap_{\alpha \in A} Z_\alpha$ be the intersection of all open and closed subsets $Z_\alpha$ of $X$ containing $x$. Note that $S$ is closed in $X$. Note that any finite intersection of $Z_\alpha$'s is a $Z_\alpha$. Because $T$ is connected and $x \in T$ we have $T \subset Z_\alpha$ for every \(Z_\alpha\), thus \(T \subset S\). It suffices to show that $S$ is connected. If not, then there exists a disjoint union decomposition $S = B \amalg C$ with $B$ and $C$ open and closed in $S$. In particular, $B$ and $C$ are closed in $X$, and so quasi-compact by assumption (1). By assumption (2) there exist quasi-compact opens $U, V \subset X$ with $B = S \cap U$ and $C = S \cap V$. Then $U \cap V \cap S = \emptyset$. Hence $\bigcap_\alpha U \cap V \cap Z_\alpha = \emptyset$. By assumption (3) the intersection $U \cap V$ is quasi-compact. Hence for some $\alpha' \in A$ we have $U \cap V \cap Z_{\alpha'} = \emptyset$. Since $X - (U \cup V)$ is disjoint from $S$ and closed in $X$ hence quasi-compact, we can use the same argument to see that $Z_{\alpha''} \subset U \cup V$ for some $\alpha'' \in A$. Then $Z_\alpha = Z_{\alpha'} \cap Z_{\alpha''}$ is contained in $U \cup V$ and disjoint from $U \cap V$. Hence $Z_\alpha = U \cap Z_\alpha \amalg V \cap Z_\alpha$ is a decomposition into two open pieces, hence $U \cap Z_\alpha$ and $V \cap Z_\alpha$ are open and closed in $X$. Thus, if $x \in B$ say, then we see that $S \subset U \cap Z_\alpha$ and we conclude that $C = \emptyset$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/04PL}{Tag 04PL}]{stacks-project}}]
  \label{thm:intersection-closed-open-iff} % This is spectral minus sober, we only need X spectral version.
  Let $X$ be a topological space. Assume $X$ is quasi-compact, quasi-separated
  and prespectral. Then for a subset $T \subset X$ the following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $T$ is an intersection of open and closed subsets of $X$, and
    \item $T$ is closed in $X$ and is a union of connected components of $X$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{thm:connected-component-intersection-closed-open}
  It is clear that (a) implies (b). Assume (b). Let $x \in X$, $x \notin T$. Let $x \in C \subset X$ be the connected component of $X$ containing $x$. By \Cref{thm:connected-component-intersection-closed-open} we see that $C = \bigcap V_\alpha$ is the intersection of all open and closed subsets $V_\alpha$ of $X$ which contain $C$. In particular, any pairwise intersection $V_\alpha \cap V_\beta$ occurs as a $V_\alpha$ i.e. is still open and closed. As $T$ is a union of connected components of $X$ we see that $C \cap T = \emptyset$. Hence $T \cap \bigcap V_\alpha = \emptyset$. Since $T$ is quasi-compact as a closed subset of a quasi-compact space, we deduce that $T \cap V_\alpha = \emptyset$ for some $\alpha$. For this $\alpha$ we see that $U_\alpha = X - V_\alpha$ is an open and closed subset of $X$ which contains $T$ and not $x$. The lemma follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $f\colon X \to Y$ be an embedding of topological spaces. Then $f$ preserves and reflects
    specializations, i.e. for $a, b \in X$, $a$ specializes to $b$ if and only if $f(a)$ specializes to $f(b)$.
    \label{lemma:embedding-specializations}
    \lean{Topology.IsEmbedding.specializes_iff}
    \leanok
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    The only if direction holds for any continuous map. Conversely, if $f(a)$ specializes to $f(b)$, then
    $b \in f^{-1}(\overline{\{f(a)\}}) = \overline{\{a\} }$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    Let $X$ be a topological space and $Z \subseteq X$ a subset. The set
    \[
    Z^g = \{ x \in X \mid \exists z \in Z, x \rightsquigarrow z \}
    \] is called the \emph{generalization of $Z$ in $X$}.
    \label{def:generalization}
    \lean{generalizationHull}
    \leanok
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $Z \subseteq X$ be a subset of a topological space. Then $Z^g$ is closed under generalization.
    \label{lemma:generalization-stable-generalization}
    \lean{stableUnderGeneralization_generalizationHull}
    \leanok
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \leanok
    This is immediate from the definition.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0906}{Tag 0906}]{stacks-project}}]
  \label{thm:pi0-profinite}
  Let $X$ be a spectral space. Then $\pi_0(X)$ is a profinite space.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{thm:connected-component-intersection-closed-open}
  We will show that \(X\) is Hausdorff, quasi-compact, and totally disconnected.
  By \Cref{thm:connected-component-intersection-closed-open}, every connected component of \(X\) is the intersection of the open and closed subsets containing it. Since \(\pi_0(X)\) is the image of a quasi-compact space, it is also quasi-compact. It is totally disconnected by construction. Let \(C,D \subset X\) be distinct connected components of \(X\). Write \(C = \bigcap_{\alpha} U_\alpha\) as the intersection of the open and closed subsets of \(X\) containing \(C\). Any finite intersection of \(U_\alpha\)'s is another \(U_\alpha\). Since \(\bigcap_\alpha U_\alpha \cap D = \emptyset\) we conclude that \(U_\alpha \cap D = \emptyset\) for some \(\alpha\) (connected components are closed, thus quasi-compact). Since \(U_\alpha\) is open and closed, it is the union of the connected components it contains, i.e., \(U_\alpha\) is the inverse image of some open and closed subset \(V_\alpha \subset \pi_0(X)\). This proves that the points corresponding to \(C\) and \(D\) are contained in disjoint open subsets, i.e., \(\pi_0(X)\) is Hausdorff.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{thm:closed-subspace-spectral}
  Let $X$ be a spectral space. Let $Y \subset X$ be a closed subspace. Then $Y$ is spectral.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  The only thing remaining to show is that $Y$ is sober. Let $Z \subset Y$ be a closed irreducible subset, then $Z$ is also closed in $X$. $Z$ is irreducible in $X$ since any nontrivial closed subset decomposition in $X$ will give a nontrivial closed subset decomposition in $Y$, thus $Z$ has a unique generic point $z \in X$. Since $Z \subset Y$ we have $z \in Y$ with the closure of $z$ in $Y$ is $Z$. This shows that $Y$ is sober.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{thm:closure-product}
  Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. Let $(x, y) \in X \times Y$ be a point. Then 
  \[\overline{\{(x, y)\}} = \overline{\{x\}} \times \overline{\{y\}}.\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  It is clear that \(\overline{\{(x, y)\}} \subseteq \overline{\{x\}} \times \overline{\{y\}}\).

  If \(z \notin \overline{\{(x, y)\}}\), there exists opens \(U \subset X\), \(V \subset Y\) such that \(z \notin U \times V\), thus \((x, y) \notin U \times V\). Either \(x \notin U\) or \(y \notin V\), suppose \(x \notin U\). Then \(U \cap \overline{\{x\}} = \emptyset\), thus \(U \times V \cap \overline{\{x\}} \times \overline{\{y\}}  = \emptyset\). This shows that \(\overline{\{x\}} \times \overline{\{y\}} \subseteq \overline{\{(x, y)\}}\).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0907}{Tag 0907}]{stacks-project}}]
  \label{thm:spectral-product}
  Let $X$ and $Y$ be spectral spaces. Then the product $X \times Y$ is spectral.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{thm:closure-product}
  Let $X$, $Y$ be spectral spaces. Denote $p : X \times Y \to X$ and $q : X \times Y \to Y$ the projections. We first show that \(X \times Y\) is sober. Let $Z \subset X \times Y$ be a closed irreducible subset. Then $p(Z) \subset X$ is irreducible and $q(Z) \subset Y$ is irreducible. Let $x \in X$ be the generic point of the closure of $p(Z)$ and let $y \in Y$ be the generic point of the closure of $q(Z)$. If $(x, y) \notin Z$, then there exist opens $x \in U \subset X$, $y \in V \subset Y$ such that $Z \cap (U \times V) = \emptyset$. Hence $Z$ is contained in $(X - U) \times Y \cup X \times (Y - V)$. Since $Z$ is irreducible, we see that either $Z \subset (X - U) \times Y$ or $Z \subset X \times (Y - V)$. In the first case $p(Z) \subset (X - U)$ and in the second case $q(Z) \subset (Y - V)$. Both cases are absurd as $x$ is in the closure of $p(Z)$ and $y$ is in the closure of $q(Z)$. Thus we conclude that $(x, y) \in Z$, which means that $(x, y)$ is the generic point for $Z$ (\Cref{thm:closure-product}).

  A basis of the topology of $X \times Y$ consists of opens of the form $U \times V$ with $U \subset X$ and $V \subset Y$ quasi-compact open (here we use that $X$ and $Y$ are spectral). Then $U \times V$ is quasi-compact as the product of quasi-compact spaces is quasi-compact. Moreover, any quasi-compact open of $X \times Y$ is a finite union of such quasi-compact rectangles $U \times V$. It follows that the intersection of two such is again quasi-compact (since $X$ and $Y$ are spectral). This concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/096C}{Tag 096C}, first part]{stacks-project}}]
Let $X$ be a spectral space. Let
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
Y \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & T \arrow[d] \\
X \arrow[r] & \pi_0(X)
\end{tikzcd}
\]
be a cartesian diagram in the category of topological spaces with $T$ profinite. Then $Y$ is spectral and $T = \pi_0(Y)$.
\label{thm:cartesian-profinite}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{thm:pi0-profinite,thm:spectral-product,thm:closed-subspace-spectral,thm:pi0-to-totally-disconnected,thm:pi0-to-totally-disconnected-injective}
  Note that $Y$ is a closed subspace of $X \times T$ (see \verb`TopCat.pullbackIsoProdSubtype`) as $\pi_0(X)$ is a profinite space (\Cref{thm:pi0-profinite}) hence Hausdorff. Since $X \times T$ is spectral (\Cref{thm:spectral-product}) it follows that $Y$ is spectral (\Cref{thm:closed-subspace-spectral}). Let $Y \to \pi_0(Y) \to T$ be the canonical factorization in \Cref{thm:pi0-to-totally-disconnected}. It is clear that $\pi_0(Y) \to T$ is surjective. The fibres of $Y \to T$ are homeomorphic to the fibres of $X \to \pi_0(X)$. Hence these fibres are connected. It follows that $\pi_0(Y) \to T$ is injective by \Cref{thm:pi0-to-totally-disconnected-injective}. We conclude that $\pi_0(Y) \to T$ is a homeomorphism since it is a bijective map from a quasi-compact space to a Hausdorff space by \verb`isHomeomorph_iff_continuous_bijective`.
\end{proof}

The following pure algebraic lemma will be used in \Cref{thm:isom-of-identifies-local-rings-w-local-isom-pi0}.

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00EA}{Tag 00EA}, (1) + (2)(a)]{stacks-project}}]
  \label{thm:localization-isom-of-going-down}
  Let $A \to B$ be a ring map which has going down. Let $\p \subset A$ be a prime ideal and let $\q \subset B$ be a prime ideal lying over $\p$. Assume that and there is at most one prime of $B$ above every prime of $A$. Then the natural map $B_{\p B} \to B_{\q}$ is an isomorphism.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  It suffices to show that all the elements of $B - \q$ are all invertible in $B_{\p B}$. Suppose the contrary, let $x \in B - \q$ be an element not invertible in $B_{\p B}$. We can find a prime ideal $\q' \subseteq \p B$ of $B$ containing $x$. By going down there exists a prime $\q'' \subseteq \q$ lying over $\p' = A \cap \q'$. By the uniqueness of primes lying over $\p'$ we see that $\q' = \q''$, which contradicts the fact that $x \notin \q$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Local isomorphisms, {\cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/096E}{Tag 096E} (1)]{stacks-project}}]
  \label{def:local-isomorphism}
  We say $A \to B$ is a \emph{local isomorphism} if for every prime $\mathfrak{q} \subset B$ there exists a $g \in B$, $g \notin \mathfrak{q}$ such that $A \to B_g$ induces an open immersion $\Spec (B_g) \to \Spec (A)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Identify local rings, {\cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/096E}{Tag 096E} (2)]{stacks-project}}]

  Define the functor

  \uses{def:identifies-local-ring-to-top}

  \[
  B \longmapsto \Spec (B)
  \]
  from the category of $A$-algebras $B$ such that $A \to B$ identifies local rings to the category of topological spaces over $X$ is fully faithful.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The functor \(F\) is a composition of two functors:
1. The fully faithful functor from the category of \(A\)-algebras \(B\) for which \(A \to B\) identifies local rings to the category of ringed spaces \((Y, \O_Y)\) over \(X = \Spec(A)\) satisfying \(\O_Y = p^{-1}\O_X\), where \(p: Y \to X\) is the structure map.
2. The functor sending a ringed space to its underlying topological space, and a morphism \((f, f^\#)\) to \(f\).

The second functor is fully faithful because \(f^\#\) is always an isomorphism, being given by the canonical identification \(f^{-1}\O_Y \cong f^{-1}p^{-1}\O_X = q^{-1}\O_X \cong \O_Z\), where \(p: Y \to X\) and \(q: Z \to X\) are the structure maps.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $A = \colim_i A_i$ be a filtered colimit of $A$-algebras and let $B$ be an étale $A$-algebra. Then
    there exists an $i$ and an étale $A_i$-algebra $B'$ such that

    \] is a pushout diagram.
    \label{lemma:etale-ind-spreads}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    This follows because every étale algebra is of finite presentation and by possibly enlarging $i$ we can ensure
    that $B'$ is étale over $A_i$.

\section{ind-Zariski maps}

\begin{definition}[Ind-Zariski, {\cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/096N}{Tag 096N}]{stacks-project}}]

    An $R$-algebra $S$ is called a \emph{ind-Zariski} if $S$ can be written as a filtered colimit $S \simeq \colim S_i$ with each $R \to S_i$ a local isomorphism. A ring homomorphism $f : R \to S$ is called a \emph{ind-Zariski} if $S$ is ind-Zariski as an $R$-algebra via $f$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  The definition of ind-Zariski is slightly more general from \cite[Definition 2.2.1(iv)]{proetale}, where they defined as a filtered colimit of finite products of principal localizations.

  Let $A \to B$ be an ind-Zariski ring map. Then it identifies local rings, i.e. for every prime $\mathfrak{q} \subset B$ the canonical map $A_{\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{q})} \to B_{\mathfrak{q}}$ is an isomorphism.

    A filtered colimit of ind-Zariski algebras is ind-Zariski.
    \label{lemma:ind-ind-Zariski}
  \uses{def:ind-Zariski}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    This follows from general theory, because local isomorphisms are of finite presentation.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  A finite product of ind-Zariski algebras is ind-Zariski.
  \label{lemma:ind-Zariski-products}
  \uses{def:ind-Zariski}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  This is the consequence of the more general fact that if a property $p$ of ring maps is stable under finite products, then Ind-$p$ is also stable under finite products since finite product of filtered index category is again filtered. 
  
  It suffices to show that being local isomorphism is stable under finite products. Suppose $A \to B_i$ is a local isomorphism for each $i$ for finitely many $i$'s. Every prime $\q$ in $\prod_i B_i$ is an extension prime ideal of one of the factors, say $B_0$. Since there exists $f_0 \in B_0$, $f_0 \notin \q$ such that $A \to (B_0)_{f_0}$ induces an open immersion, localize $\prod_i B_i$ at the corresponding idempotent times this element \(f_0\) to obtain the desired result.
\end{proof}

    \begin{tikzcd}
        X \arrow{r}{u} \arrow[swap]{dr}{f} & Z \arrow{d}{v} \\
                    & Y,
    \end{tikzcd}
    \] with $u$ satisfying $P$, there exists a retraction of $u$.
    \label{def:p-henselian}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    A local ring $(R, \mathfrak{m}, \kappa)$ is Henselian if and only if the projection $R \to \kappa$ is étale-Henselian.
\end{example}

\begin{proof}
    By {\cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/04GG}{Tag 04GG}]{stacks-project}}, $R$ is Henselian if and only if
    for any étale ring map $R \to S$ and prime $\mathfrak{q}$ of $S$ lying over $\mathfrak{m}$ with $\kappa = \kappa(\mathfrak{q})$,
    there exists a retraction $S \to R$ of $R \to S$.

    Suppose $R$ is Henselian and let $R \to S \to \kappa$ be a factorisation of $R \to \kappa$ with $R \to S$ étale. Then
    $\mathfrak{q} = \mathrm{ker}(S \to \kappa)$ is a prime ideal of $S$ lying above $\mathfrak{m}$. Hence we obtain a commutative
    diagram
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
        R \arrow{r} \arrow{d} & S \arrow{r} \arrow{d} & \kappa \\
        \kappa \arrow[dashed]{r} & \kappa(\mathfrak{q}) \arrow[dashed]{ur},
        \end{tikzcd}
    \] where the composition of the dashed arrows is the identity of $\kappa$. Hence $\kappa(\mathfrak{q}) = \kappa$ and by assumption,
    $R \to S$ has a retraction.

    Now assume that $R \to \kappa$ is étale-Henselian and let $R \to S$ be étale and $\mathfrak{q}$ be a prime ideal of $S$ with
    $\kappa(\mathfrak{q}) = \kappa$. Hence the composition $R \to S \to \kappa(\mathfrak{q}) = \kappa$ is a factorisation
    of $R \to \kappa$. Thus $R \to S$ has a retraction.

    \uses{def:p-henselian}
    \label{def:strictly-henselian-local-ring}
    A local ring $(R, \mathfrak{m}, \kappa)$ is \emph{strictly henselian} if the composition $R \to \kappa \to \kappa^{\mathrm{sep}}$ is étale-Henselian
    for a separable closure $\kappa^{\mathrm{sep}}$.
\end{definition}

The following example shows that our definition agrees with the one in
\cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/04GF}{Tag 04GF}]{stacks-project}.

\begin{example}
    A local ring $(R, \mathfrak{m}, \kappa)$ is strictly Henselian if and only if it is Henselian and $\kappa$ is separably closed.
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}
    \label{thm:strictly-henselian-good-retraction}
    \uses{def:strictly-henselian-local-ring}
    Let \(A, \m\) be a strictly henselian local ring. Let \(f : A \to B\) a \'etale ring map with \(\n\) a maximal ideal of \(B\) lying over \(\m\). Then there exists a retraction \(s : B \to A\) of \(A \to B\) such that \(\n = s^{-1}(\m)\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Since \(B/\m B\) is an étale algebra over the residue field \(k = A/\m\), it splits as \(B/\m B \cong k_1 \times \cdots \times k_n\) for finitely many finite separable extensions \(k_i\) of \(k\). Thus \(B/\n\), as a quotient of \(B/\m B\), is also a finite separable extension of \(k\). Choose an inclusion \(B/\n \hookrightarrow k^{\sep}\). Then we have a commutative diagram
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    A \arrow{r} \arrow{d} & B \arrow{d}\arrow{rd} & \\
    k \arrow{r} & B/\n \arrow{r} & k^{\sep}.
  \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  Since \(A \to k^{\sep}\) is étale-Henselian, there exists a retraction \(r : B \to A\) of \(A \to B\). But this retraction may not satisfy \(\n = r^{-1}(\m)\). 
  
  To solve this, notice that there are only finitely many prime ideals \(\n_0 = \n, \n_1, \cdots, \n_k\) of \(B\) lying over \(\m\) and they are all maximal ideals. (directly by the fact that \(B/\m B \cong k_1 \times \cdots \times k_n\)). Since \(\bigcap_{i \ne 0} \n_i \nsubseteq \n\) (otherwise one of \(\n_i \subseteq \n\) which is impossible), we can find element \(b \in \n_i\) for every \(i \ne 0\) that does not fall in $\n$. We may replace \((B, \n)\) by \((B_b, \n B_b)\), then \(B\) is still étale over \(A\) and \(\n\) is the only prime ideal of \(B\) lying over \(\m\). Then the section \(s_b : B_b \to A\) given by the previous paragraph satisfies \(\n B_b = s_b^{-1}(\m)\). Composition with the localization map \(B \to B_b\) gives the desired section \(s : B \to A\).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
    \label{thm:etale-over-strictly-henselian-localization-isom}
    \uses{def:strictly-henselian-local-ring}
    Let \(A\) be a strictly Henselian local ring and \(f : A \to B\) an étale ring map. Suppose \(\n\) is a maximal ideal of \(B\) lying over the maximal ideal \(\m\) of \(A\). Then the induced map \(A \to B_\n\) is an isomorphism.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{thm:strictly-henselian-good-retraction}
  Let \(s: B \to A\) be the section given by \Cref{thm:strictly-henselian-good-retraction} for the pair \((B, \n)\). Localizing at \(\m\), we obtain the following diagram:
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    A = A_\m \arrow[r, "f_\m"]\arrow[dr, "f'"'] & B_\m \arrow[d] \arrow[r, "s_\m"] & A \\
    & B_\n \arrow[ur, dotted, "s'"'] &
  \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  The dotted arrow \(s'\) exists by the universal property of localization, since \(\n = s^{-1}(\m)\). Moreover, \(s'\) is a section of \(f'\).

  Since \(f_\m\) is étale and \(s_\m\) is a section of \(f_\m\), it follows that \(s_\m\) is also étale by the cancellation property of étale maps. Thus \(s'\), being a composition of a localization and an étale map, is flat. As a flat local ring homomorphism, \(s'\) is faithfully flat and hence injective. Since \(s'\) is also a section of \(f'\), it is surjective. Therefore, \(s'\) is an isomorphism, and the composition \(A \to B_\n\) is an isomorphism.
\end{proof}

    Let $x \rightsquigarrow y$ in $X$ with $x \in Z^g$. Then $x$ specializes to some $z \in Z$, which

    $Z^c$ is closed in $Z$ and $Z \to X$ preserves closed points.
    By \ref{lemma:embedding-specializations}, specializations
    in $Z$ are the same as specializations in $X$. Since $Z$ is closed

\begin{lemma}
    Let $X$ be a profinite topological space and $x, y \in X$ be distinct. Then

  Write $X = \lim_{i \in I} X_i$ as a directed limit of finite discrete spaces. Let $\pi_i \colon X \to X_i$ be the
  projection maps. A base of the open sets of $X$ is given by the preimages $\pi_i^{-1}(\{z\})$ for $z \in X_i$ and $i \in I$. Every open set in this base is also closed, because its complement is a finite union of such sets.

  Choose an open subset in this base containing $x$ but not $y$, say $U = \pi_{i_0}^{-1}(\{z_0\})$ for some $i_0 \in I$ and $z_0 \in X_{i_0}$. Then $V = X - U$ is also open and closed, and we have $X = U \coprod V$ with $x \in U$ and $y \in V$.

  Since every point is closed, there are no nontrivial specializations between points. By \Cref{item:specialization-closed-spectral-constructible-closed-closed} in \Cref{lemma:spectral-constructible-closed-closed}, all constructible subsets of $X$ are closed. In particular, every compact open subset is also closed. Since $X$ is spectral, thus T0, for any two points there is a quasi-compact open (also closed) containing exactly one of them. Thus $X$ is profinite by \verb`isTotallyDisconnected_of_isClopen_set`.

  \label{lemma:spectral-generalization-intersection-open}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $X$ be a spectral space and let $W$ denote $E^g$. Since every point of $W$ specializes to a point of $E$ we see that an open of $W$ which contains $E$ is equal to $W$. Hence since $E$ is quasi-compact, so is $W$. If $x \in X$, $x \notin W$, then $Z = \overline{\{x\}}$ is disjoint from $W$. Since $W$ is quasi-compact we can find a quasi-compact open $U$ (since there is a open basis of quasi-compact opens of $X$ and finitely many of them would suffice to cover $W$) with $W \subset U$ and $U \cap Z = \emptyset$. We conclude that $W$ is an intersection of quasi-compact open subsets.
\end{proof}

In other words, a subset of $X$ is open in the constructible topology if and only if
it is a union of finite intersections of sets of the form $U$ or $X - U$ for
a quasi-compact open $U$.

\begin{lemma}[\stacksproject{0901}]

    \label{lemma:spectral-constructible-quasi-compact}
    \lean{compactSpace_withConstructibleTopology}
    \leanok
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\mathfrak{B}$ be the set of subsets of $X$ that are quasi-compact open or
    the complement of a quasi-compact open.
    By definition of the constructible topology and the Alexander subbasis theorem,
    it suffices to show that every covering $X = \bigcup_{i \in  I} B_i$
    with $B_i \in \mathfrak{B}$ has a finite subcover. Since
    for every $B \in \mathfrak{B}$ also $X - B \in \mathfrak{B}$,
    it suffices to show: If $\{B_i\}_{i \in I}$ is a family of elements
    of $\mathfrak{B}$ such that all finite subfamilies have non-empty intersection,
    then $\bigcap_{i \in  I} B_i$ is non-empty.

    Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the set of families in $\mathfrak{B}$ that are pairwise unequal, have non-empty
    finite intersections and empty intersection. For the sake of contradiction, suppose
    $\mathcal{S}$ is non-empty. If we equip $\mathcal{S}$ with the ordering by subset inclusion,
    Zorn's Lemma yields a maximal family $\{B_i\}_{i \in I} \in \mathcal{S}$.

    Let $I' \subseteq I$ be the indices such that $B_i$ is closed and set $Z = \bigcap_{i \in  I'} B_i$.
    This is a closed and non-empty subset of $X$, because $X$ is quasi-compact
    and all finite intersections are non-empty by assumption.
    Note that for any $i_1, \ldots, i_n \in I$ the intersection $\bigcap_{a=1}^n B_{i_a}$ is quasi-compact,
    hence $Z \cap \bigcap_{a=1}^n B_{i_a}$ is non-empty by the same argument.

    Suppose $Z = Z' \cup Z'$ is reducible with $Z', Z'' \subsetneq Z$ closed. Because
    $X$ is quasi-separated, there exist quasi-compact opens $U', U'' \subseteq X$ with
    $U' \cap Z'$ non-empty, $U'' \cap Z''$ non-empty and $U' \cap Z'' = \emptyset = U'' \cap Z'$.
    Then set $B' = X - U' \in \mathfrak{B}$ and $B'' = X - U'' \in \mathfrak{B}$. We
    claim that $\{B_i\}_{i \in I}$ with $B'$ or $B''$ added is still in $\mathcal{S}$. Suppose,
    this is not the case. Then there exist finitely many indices
    $i_a$ and $j_b$ in $I$ such that
    \[
    B' \cap \bigcap_{a=1}^n B_{i_a} = \emptyset = B'' \cap \bigcap_{b=1}^m B_{j_b}
    .\] By construction, $Z \subseteq B' \cup B''$, so in particular
    \[
    Z \cap \bigcap_{a=1}^n B_{i_a} \cap \bigcap_{b=1}^m B_{j_b} = \emptyset
    .\] which is a contradiction. Hence $\{B_i\}_{i \in I}$ is not maximal, also a contradiction. So
    $Z$ is irreducible. But for every $i \in I - I'$, the set $B_i$ is open and hence
    the non-empty open $Z \cap B_i$ of $Z$ contains the unique generic point of $Z$. Hence
    $\bigcap_{i \in  I} B_i = Z \cap \bigcap_{i \in  I - I'}$ is non-empty, which is again a contradiction.

    It suffices to show the first claim. Let $x \in \overline{E}$
    and let $\{U_i\}_{i \in I}$ be the set of quasi-compact open neighbourhoods of $x$.
    Since $X$ is spectral, these form a neighbourhood basis of $x$, so $\bigcap_{i \in  I} U_i$
    is the set of generalizations of $x$. It hence suffices to show
    that $\bigcap_{i \in  I} U_i \cap E$ is non-empty. Indeed,
    as $X$ is quasi-separated, any finite intersection of the $U_i$ is another one and
    since $x \in \overline{E}$, the intersection $U_i \cap E$ is non-empty for all $i$.
    Since $U_i \cap E$ is closed in the constructible topology for all $i$
    and $X$ is quasi-compact in the constructible topology by \ref{lemma:spectral-constructible-quasi-compact},
    the intersection $\bigcap_{i \in  I} U_i \cap E$ is non-empty.

    Since $X^c$ is quasi-compact and $\pi_0(X)$ is Hausdorff by \Cref{thm:pi0-profinite}, it suffices

    To show injectivity let $x, y \in X^c$ be distinct. Since $X^c$ is profinite
    (\Cref{lemma:w-local-closed-points-profinite}), there
    exist open and closed subsets $U_0, V_0 \subseteq X^c$ such that
    $X^c = U_0 \coprod V_0$ by \Cref{lemma:profinite-disj-clopen-separation}.
    Let $U = U_0^g$ and $V = V_0^g$. Because $X$ is w-local, we get
    $X = U \coprod V$ as sets. By \Cref{lemma:w-local-generalization-closed-closed},
    both $U$ and $V$ are closed and therefore also both open. Hence
    $x$ and $y$ lie in distinct connected components of $X$, so the images in $\pi_0(X)$ are distinct.

    Since every connected component is closed, it is quasi-compact and hence contains a closed point. Thus
    the map is surjective.

\label{thm:cartesian-profinite-w-local}
\uses{def:w-local-space,def:w-local-space-map}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{thm:cartesian-profinite,thm:closed-points-isom-pi0}
  We know that $Y$ is spectral and $T = \pi_0(Y)$ by \Cref{thm:cartesian-profinite}. Assume $X$ is w-local and let $X^c \subset X$ be its closed points. The inverse image $Y^c \subset Y$ of $X^c$ maps bijectively onto $T$, since $X^c \to \pi_0(X)$ is a bijection by \Cref{thm:closed-points-isom-pi0}. (Note that we do not yet know whether $Y^c$ is the set of closed points of $Y$.) Moreover, $Y^c$ is quasi-compact as a closed subset of the spectral space $Y$. Hence $Y^c \to \pi_0(Y) = T$ is a homeomorphism by \verb`isHomeomorph_iff_continuous_bijective` (\stacksproject{08YE}). It follows that all points of $Y^c$ are closed in $Y$: if some $y \in Y^c$ specialized to a distinct closed point $y'$ (which also falls in $Y$ since $Y$ is closed), then both would map to the same point in $T$, contradicting the bijectivity of $Y^c \to T$.

  Conversely, if $y \in Y$ is a closed point, then it is closed in its fibre over $T$, and its image $x \in X$ is closed in the corresponding (homeomorphic) fibre of $X \to \pi_0(X)$. Since a point in a w-local space is closed if and only if it is closed in its connected component (which is closed), we have $x \in X^c$, so $y \in Y^c$. Thus $Y^c$ is exactly the set of closed points of $Y$. Moreover, since $Y^c \cong T$, each connected component contains a unique closed point, and for each $y \in Y^c$ the set of generalizations of $y$ is precisely the fibre of $Y \to \pi_0(Y)$ (as any generalization of $y$ lies in the same connected component with $y$). The lemma follows.

  If \(A \to B\) is a surjective ring map and \(A\) is w-local, then \(B\) is w-local.

\begin{lemma}

  \uses{def:w-local-ring}
  Let $A$ be a w-local ring. Then $\Spec (A)$ is set theoretically the disjoint union of the spectra of the local
  rings at closed points.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  This follows from the fact that every point specializes to a unique closed point and the spectrum of the local ring at a point is the set of all points specialize to it.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{thm:isom-of-identifies-local-rings-bijective}
  \uses{def:identify-local-rings}
  Let $A \to B$ be a ring map such that
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $A \to B$ identifies local rings, and
    \item $\Spec (B) \to \Spec (A)$ is bijective.
  \end{enumerate}
  Then $A \to B$ is an isomorphism.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \uses{thm:localization-isom-of-going-down,}
    Since $A \to B$ is flat (can be checked on stalks of \(B\)), it has going down. % Algebra.HasGoingDown.of_flat
    Thus \Cref{thm:localization-isom-of-going-down} shows for any prime $\q \subset B$ lying over $\p \subset A$ we have $B_{\q} = B_{\p B}$. Since $B_{\q} = A_{\p}$ by assumption, we see that $A_{\p} = B_{\p B}$ for all primes $\p$ of $A$. Thus $A = B$ since isomorphism can be checked locally on $A$.

  \label{thm:isom-of-identifies-local-rings-w-local-isom-pi0}

  Let $A \to B$ be a w-local ring map between w-local rings such that

    \item $A \to B$ identifies local rings, and
    \item $\pi_0(\Spec (B)) \to \pi_0(\Spec (A))$ is bijective.

\begin{proof}
  \uses{thm:closed-points-isom-pi0,thm:w-local-set-decomposition,
    thm:isom-of-identifies-local-rings-bijective}
  By \Cref{thm:isom-of-identifies-local-rings-bijective}, it suffices to show
  that $Y = \Spec (B) \to X = \Spec (A)$ is bijective.
  Let $X^c \subset X$ and $Y^c \subset Y$ be the sets of closed points. By assumption $Y^c$ maps into $X^c$ and the induced map $Y^c \to X^c$ is a bijection since \Cref{thm:closed-points-isom-pi0} holds. By \Cref{thm:w-local-set-decomposition}, we see that both $X$ and $Y$ , as sets, are disjoint unions of the spectra of the local rings at closed points. As \(A \to B\) identifies local rings, $Y \to X$ is a bijection.
\end{proof}

The goal of the remaining part of this section is to show that for every ring $A$, there exists a faithfully flat, ind-Zariski
$A$-algebra $A_{w}$ with $A_w$ w-local. Let $A$ be a ring.

\begin{definition}
    Let $f \in A$ be an element and $I \subseteq A$ an ideal.
    Let $S_{f, I} \subseteq A$ be the multiplicative subset of elements which map to invertible
    elements of $(A/I)_{f}$.
    We define $\tildering{A}{I}{f}$ to be the $A$-algebra $S_{f, I}^{-1}$
    and $\tildeideal{I}{f} \subseteq \tildering{A}{I}{f}$ to be the kernel of
    the induced map $\tildering{A}{I}{f} \to (A / I)_{f}$.
    \label{def:tilde-locclosed}
\end{definition}

If $Z \subseteq \spec{A}$ is a locally closed subscheme of the form $D(f) \cap V(I)$, we
also write $A_{\widetilde{Z}}$ instead of $\tildering{A}{I}{f}$.
In the following, when we use the notation $A_{\widetilde{Z}}$ there is always a canonical
choice of $I$ and $f$ for $Z$.
In general this notation is justified by the fact that, up to isomorphism, the ring $A_{\widetilde{Z}}$ does not depend
on the choice of $f$ and $I$ \stacksproject{096V}.

\begin{lemma}[{\stacksproject{096V}}]
    \uses{def:generalization, def:tilde-locclosed}
    \label{lemma:locally-closed-specializations}
    Let $f \in A$ be an element and $I \subseteq A$ an ideal.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The map $\spec{\tildering{A}{I}{f}} \to \spec{A}$ induces
            a homeomorphism onto the generalization of $D(f) \cap V(g)$.
        \item The closed subscheme $V(\tildeideal{I}{f})$ induces an isomorphism
            onto $D(f) \cap V(I)$.
            \label{item:closed-subscheme-tilde}
        \item If $A'$ is a ring with an element $f' \in A$ and ideal $I' \subseteq A'$ and
            $A \to A'$ is a ring map that maps
            $D(f') \cap V(I')$ into $D(f) \cap V(I)$, then there is a unique $A$-algebra map
            $\tildering{A}{I}{f} \to \tildering{A'}{I'}{f'}$ making the obvious
            diagram with $A \to A'$ commute.
    \end{enumerate}
    In particular, every
    point in $\spec{\tildering{A}{I}{f}}$ specializes to a point in $V(\tildeideal{I}{f})$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let $S = S_{f, I}$, $Z = D(f) \cap V(I)$ and $J = \tildeideal{I}{f}$.

    Note that $Z$ is homeomorphic to $\spec{(A/I)_f}$.
    Since the map $\spec{S^{-1}A} \to \spec{A}$ is a homeomorphism onto its image, to show (1)
    it suffices to show that the image is the set of points of $\spec{A}$ specializing to $D(f) \cap V(I)$.
    Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime of $A$ specializing to a $\mathfrak{q}$ in $Z$,
    so $I \subseteq \mathfrak{q}$ and $f \not\in \mathfrak{q}$. In particular, the image
    of every element of $\mathfrak{p}$ in $(A / I)_f$ is contained in $\mathfrak{q}$ and
    is therefore not invertible.
    Conversely, let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime of $A$ which does not specialize to a point in
    $Z$, hence
    the image of $\mathfrak{p}$ in $(A/I)_f$ contains the unit element. So there exists
    $g \in \mathfrak{p}$ that becomes invertible in $(A / I)_f$, so $g \in S$ and
    $\mathfrak{p}$ is not in the image of $\spec{S^{-1} A}$.

    By construction, the induced map $S^{-1}A \to (A / I)_f$ is surjective and hence
    induces an isomorphism $S^{-1}A / J \to (A / I)_f$. This shows (2).

    Let $g \in A$. Suppose the image of $g$ in $(A' / I')_{f'}$ is not invertible.
    Then there exists a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $(A' / I')_{f'}$ that contains the image of $g$.
    Hence $g$ is in the preimage of $\mathfrak{p}$ under $A \to A'$, which lies in $Z$ by assumption. Thus
    $g$ is not invertible in $(A / I)_f$, which shows $g \not\in S$.
\end{proof}

In view of \ref{lemma:locally-closed-specializations}, given $Z = D(f) \cap V(I)$ we may
view $Z$ as a closed subscheme of $\spec{A_{\widetilde{Z}}}$ defined by the ideal
$V( \tildeideal{I}{f})$.

\begin{lemma}
    Let $f \in A$ be an element and $I \subseteq A$ an ideal. Then
    $\tildering{A}{I}{f}$ is ind-Zariski over $A$.

\begin{lemma}
    Let $E_1, F_1, E_2, F_2 \subseteq A$ be subsets such that $E_1 \subseteq E_2$ and
    $F_1 \subseteq F_2$. Then $Z(E_2, F_2) \subseteq Z(E_1, F_1)$.

\begin{lemma}
    Let $A$ be a ring, $E \subseteq A$ a finite subset. Then

    \] set theoretically.
    \uses{def:subset-stratum}
    \label{lemma:subset-stratification}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let $x \in \spec{A}$ and $E = E' \coprod E''$ a disjoint union decomposition. Then
    $x \in Z(E', E'')$ if and only if $f(x) \neq 0$ for all $f \in E'$ and $f(x) = 0$
    for all $f \in E''$. Hence $x$ is contained in
    \[
    Z(\{ f \in E  \mid f(x) \neq 0\}, \{f \in E  \mid f(x) = 0\})
    ,\] and this is the only set of this form in which $x$ is contained.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    Let $A$ be a ring and $E \subseteq A$ a finite subset. Let
    \[
    A_{E} = \prod_{E = E' \coprod E''} A_{\widetilde{Z(E', E'')}}
    .\]
    Further, we set $I_E \subseteq A$ to be the product of the ideals
    defining $Z(E', E'')$ in $\spec{A_{\widetilde{Z(E', E'')}}}$.

Note that \ref{def:finite-stratification-ring} is well-defined, because for finite
subsets $E', E''$ of $A$, the locally closed subset $Z(E', E'')$ is always
of the right form by \ref{lemma:subset-stratum-equals-inter}.

\begin{lemma}
    Let $E \subseteq A$ be a finite subset. Then
    $V(I_E) = \coprod_{E = E' \coprod E''} Z(E', E'')$. In particular,
    the map $\spec{A_E} \to \spec{A}$ induces a bijection $V(I_E) \to \spec{A}$.
    \label{lemma:finite-stratification-ideal-bijection}
    \uses{def:finite-stratification-ring}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \uses{lemma:subset-stratification}
    By definition $I_E$ is the product of the ideals defining $Z(E', E'')$ in
    $\spec{A_{\widetilde{Z(E', E'')}}}$. Hence the first claim. The second
    follows from the first, because $\spec{A} = \coprod_{E = E' \coprod E''} Z(E', E'')$ by
    \ref{lemma:subset-stratification}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $E \subseteq A$ be a finite subset. Then every point of $\spec{A_E}$ specializes
    to a point in $V(I_E)$. In particular, $V(I_E)$ contains all closed points of $\spec{A_E}$.%
    \uses{def:finite-stratification-ring}
    \label{lemma:finite-stratification-closed-points}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let $x \in \spec{A_E}$. Then $x$ is in $\spec{A_{\widetilde{Z(E', E'')}}}$ for some
    $E = E' \coprod E''$. By
    \ref{lemma:locally-closed-specializations}, $x$ specializes to a point
    in $Z(E', E'') \subseteq V(I_E)$.
    If $x$ is closed, then $x$ specializes to itself, so $x \in V(I_E)$.
\end{proof}

Let $A$ be a ring. Given finite subsets $E_1, E_2 \subseteq A$ with $E_1 \subseteq E_2$, there is a
canonical transition map $A_{E_1} \to A_{E_2}$ of $A$-algebras: For
a disjoint union decomposition $E_2 = E_2' \coprod E_2''$, we set
$E_1' = E_1 \cap E_2'$ and $E_1'' = E_1 \cap E_2''$. By \ref{lemma:subset-stratum-mono},
we obtain $Z(E_2', E_2'') \subseteq Z(E_1', E_1'')$ and hence
by \ref{lemma:locally-closed-specializations} a unique $A$-algebra map
$A_{\widetilde{Z(E_1', E_1'')}} \to A_{\widetilde{Z(E_2', E_2'')}}$.

\begin{lemma}
    Let $E_1, E_2 \subseteq A$ be finite subsets with $E_1 \subseteq E_2$.
    The induced map $\spec{A_{E_2}} \to \spec{A_{E_1}}$ maps
    $V(I_{E_2})$ into $V(I_{E_1})$.
    \uses{def:finite-stratification-ring, lemma:subset-stratum-mono}
    \label{lemma:finite-stratification-map-closed}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    This holds because for every decomposition $E_2 = E_2' \coprod E_2''$
    and $E_1' = E_1 \cap E_2'$ and $E_1'' = E_1 \cap E_2''$, the induced map
    $\spec{A_{\widetilde{Z(E_2', E_2'')}}} \to \spec{A_{\widetilde{Z(E_1', E_1'')}}}$
    maps $Z(E_2', E_2'')$ into $Z(E_1', E_1'')$.

\begin{definition}
    Let $I(A)$ be the partially ordered set of all finite subsets of $A$. We define the

    \[
    A_w = \colim_{E \in I(A)} A_E
    .\]
    We denote by $I_w \subseteq A_w$ the colimit of the ideals $I_E$, i.e.,
    the union of the images of the $I_E$ in $A_w$.%

Note that, since $I_w$ is the colimit of the ideals $I_E$, the closed subset
$V(I_w)$ is the inverse limit of the closed subsets $V(I_E)$.

    For $E \subseteq A$ a finite subset, the $A$-algebra $A_E$ is ind-Zariski
    as a finite product of ind-Zariski algebras by \ref{lemma:ind-Zariski-products}.
    Thus $A_w$ is a filtered colimit of ind-Zariski algebras, hence ind-Zariski
    by \ref{lemma:ind-ind-Zariski}.

    Let $A$ be a ring.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The composition $V(I_w) \to \spec{A_w} \to \spec{A}$ is a bijection.

        \item Every point of $\spec{A_w}$ specializes to a unique point of $V(I_w)$.
        \item $V(I_w)$ is the set of closed points of $\spec{A_w}$.
    \end{enumerate}
    In particular, $\spec{A_w}$ is w-local and the closed points of $\spec{A_w}$ surject onto $\spec{A}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \uses{lemma:finite-stratification-ideal-bijection, lemma:closure-limit}
    Since $V(I_w) = \lim_{E} V(I_E)$ and $V(I_E) \to \spec{A_E} \to \spec{A}$ is
    bijective for all $E$ by \ref{lemma:finite-stratification-ideal-bijection}, the
    first claim holds.

    We first show that every point of $\spec{A_w}$ specializes to a point in $V(I_w)$.
    For this let $y \in \spec{A_w}$. For all $E \subseteq A$ finite, denote by
    $T_E$ the closure of the image of $y$ in $\spec{A_E}$. By
    \ref{lemma:finite-stratification-closed-points}, the intersection $T_E \cap V(I_E)$ is
    non-empty. Since both $T_E$ and $V(I_E)$ are closed, the intersection is closed
    and hence quasi-compact. Thus $(\lim_E T_E) \cap V(I_w) = \lim_E (T_E \cap V(I_E))$ is non-empty.
    By \ref{lemma:closure-limit}, the subset $\lim_E T_E$ is the closure of $y$ in $\spec{A_w}$. Hence
    $y$ specializes to a point in $V(I_E)$.

    For uniqueness, suppose $y \in \spec{A_w}$ specializes to $z, z' \in V(I_w)$ with
    $z \neq z'$. Denote the images of $z, z'$ in $\spec{A}$ by $x, x'$.
    Because $V(I_w) \to \spec{A_w} \to \spec{A}$ is injective, $x$ and $x'$ are distinct. Hence we may
    assume there exists $f \in A$ such that $x \in D(f)$ and $x' \in V(f)$. Set
    $E = \{f\}$. Then
    \[
        \spec{A_E} = \spec{\tildering{A}{0}{f}} \coprod \spec{\tildering{A}{(f)}{1}}
    .\]
    Denote the images of $y, z, z'$ in $\spec{A_E}$ by $y_E, x_E, x'_E$. Since
    $x_E$ maps to $x \in D(f)$ and $x_E'$ maps to $x' \in V(f)$, they lie
    in different components of the disjoint union decomposition above. But
    since $\spec{A_w} \to \spec{A}$ is continuous, $y_E$ specializes to both $x_E$ and $x'_E$
    which is not possible.

    Finally, every closed point specializes to itself and is hence contained in $V(I_{w})$. Conversely,
    every point in $V(I_{w})$ specializes only to itself, so it is closed.
\end{proof}

    The $A$-algebra $A_w$ is faithfully flat.

\begin{proof}
    \uses{lemma:w-localization-closed-points, lemma:w-localization-ind-Zariski}
    By \ref{lemma:w-localization-ind-Zariski}, $A \to A_w$ is flat. Because
    $V(I_w)$ surjects onto $\spec{A}$ by \ref{lemma:w-localization-closed-points},
    in particular $\spec{A_w} \to \spec{A}$ is surjective, hence
    $A \to A_w$ is faithfully flat.

\begin{lemma}[\stacksproject{00GA}]
    Let $B$ be an $A$-algebra and $\mathfrak{m}$ a maximal ideal of of $R$. Let
    $\mathfrak{q}$ be a prime ideal lying over $\mathfrak{m}$ such that

    $\mathfrak{q}$ is maximal.

\begin{proof}
    We have a factorization $\kappa(\mathfrak{m}) = R / \mathfrak{m} \to S / \mathfrak{q} \to \kappa(\mathfrak{q})$.

    Let $A$ be w-local and $I \subseteq A$ an ideal. Then

    the set of closed points is $V(IA_{\widetilde{V(I)}})$.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \uses{lemma:generalization-specialization-closed, lemma:locally-closed-specializations,
      lemma:w-local-specialization-closed}
    By \ref{lemma:locally-closed-specializations}, $\spec{A_{\widetilde{V(I)}}}$ is homeomorphic
    to the generalization $V(I)^g$. Since $\spec{A}$ is w-local and $V(I)$ is closed
    under specialization, also $V(I)^g$ is closed under specialization by
    \ref{lemma:generalization-specialization-closed}. Hence
    $\spec{A_{\widetilde{V(I)}}} \cong V(I)^g$ is w-local by \ref{lemma:w-local-specialization-closed}.

    By \Cref{item:closed-subscheme-tilde}, we may identify $V(IA_{\widetilde{V(I)}})$ with
    $V(I)$.
    Since every point in
    $\spec{A_{\widetilde{V(I)}}} \cong V(I)^g$ specializes to a unique point in $V(I)$,
    the closed subset $V(I)$ contains all closed points of $\spec{A_{\widetilde{V(I)}}}$. Hence,
    if $V(I)$ only contains closed points, the closed points are exactly $V(I)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $A \to B$ be a ring map that induces algebraic extensions on residue fields
    and let $I \subseteq A$ be an ideal, such that $V(I)$ only contains closed points.
    Then $V(IB)$ only contains closed points.
    \label{lemma:preimage-closed-points-algebraic}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \uses{lemma:prime-over-maximal-algebraic}
    By \ref{lemma:prime-over-maximal-algebraic}, every prime of $B$ lying above a maximal ideal of $A$
    is maximal. In particular, the closed subset $V(I B) = (\spec{B} \to \spec{A})^{-1}(V(I))$ only contains
    closed points.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $B$ be an $A$-algebra satisfying going down. If every closed point of $\spec{A}$
    has a preimage in $\spec{B}$, the map $\spec{B} \to \spec{A}$ is surjective.
    \label{lemma:going-down-surjective-of-closed}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime of $A$. Then it is contained in a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$
    that is the preimage of a prime $\mathfrak{q}$ of $B$. By going-down, there
    exists therefore a prime $\mathfrak{q}' \subseteq \mathfrak{q}$ lying above $\mathfrak{p}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:closed-closed-points-tilde-w-local}
    Let $I \subseteq A$ be an ideal such that $V(I) \subseteq A$ only contains closed points.
    Set $B = (A_w)_{\widetilde{V(IA_{w})}}$. Then
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $B$ is w-local,
        \item the set of closed points of $B$ is $V(IB)$, and
        \item the map $A / I \to B / I B$ is an isomorphism.

    $A \to A_w$ is ind-Zariski by \ref{lemma:w-localization-ind-Zariski} and therefore induces
    algebraic extensions of residue fields by \ref{thm:ind-Zariski-identifies-local-rings}.
    In particular, the closed subset $V(I A_w)$ only contains
    closed points by \ref{lemma:preimage-closed-points-algebraic} and
    the first two claims follow from \ref{lemma:w-local-tilde-w-local}.

    The map $A \to B$ is ind-Zariski as a composition of ind-Zariski maps by
    \ref{lemma:w-localization-ind-Zariski} and \ref{lemma:tilde-locclosed-ind-zariski}.
    Since ind-Zariski is stable under base change, the same holds for $A/I \to B/IB$.
    Hence it identifies local rings. By \Cref{item:closed-subscheme-tilde},
    $V(IB) \to V(I A_w)$ is an isomorphism. Moreover
    $V(I A_{w}) \to V(I)$ is a Bijection by \Cref{item:w-localization-bijection}
    because $V(I A_{w}) \subseteq V(I_w)$. Hence, the composition
    $\spec{B / IB} = V(IB) \to V(I A_w) \to V(I)$ is bijective. Thus
    $A / I \to B / IB$ is an isomorphism by \ref{thm:isom-of-identifies-local-rings-bijective}.

Let $A \to B$ be a ring map inducing algebraic extensions on residue fields at primes. Then
there exists an ind-Zariski ring map $B \to C$ such that

\begin{proof}
    \uses{lemma:w-localization-closed-points, lemma:closed-closed-points-tilde-w-local, lemma:tilde-locclosed-ind-zariski, lemma:going-down-surjective-of-closed}
    Every point of $V(IB)$ is a closed point of $\spec{B}$ by \ref{lemma:preimage-closed-points-algebraic}.
    Hence we may choose $C = (B_w)_{\widetilde{V(IB_w)}}$ as in \ref{lemma:closed-closed-points-tilde-w-local}. Then
    the set of closed points of $C$ is $V(IC)$, which is the preimage of $V(I)$ under
    $\spec{C} \to \spec{B} \to \spec{A}$.

    $A \to B \to C$ is flat, so by \ref{lemma:going-down-surjective-of-closed} it suffices
    to show every closed point of $A$ is in the image. But since $\spec{B} \to \spec{A}$ is surjective,
    also $V(IC) \cong V(IB) \to V(I)$ is surjective.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    As we have seen in the proof of \ref{thm:closed-points-isom-w-local}, we may choose
    $C$ as $(B_w)_{\widetilde{V(IB_w)}}$.

\section{w-strictly-local Rings}

\begin{definition}[w-strictly local rings, {\cite[Definition 2.2.1(ii)]{proetale}}]
    A ring \(A\) is \emph{w-strictly local} if \(A\) is w-local, and every local ring of \(A\) at a maximal ideal is strictly henselian.
    % TODO: every faithfully flat \'etale map \(A \to B\) has a retraction. this should be a property.

    % refactor WStrictlyLocalRing, using the definition of strictly henselian
    % \lean{WStrictlyLocalRing}
    % \leanok
\end{definition}

The goal of this section is to show that every ring $A$ admits a faithfully flat, ind-étale algebra $B$ that is $w$-strictly-local.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{thm:ind-etale-strictly-henselian-localization-isom}
  \uses{def:ind-etale,def:strictly-henselian-local-ring,def:identify-local-rings}
  Let \(A\) be a strictly henselian local ring. Let \(A \to B\) be an ind-étale ring map. Let $\n$ be an maximal ideal of $B$ lying over the maximal ideal $\m$ of $A$. Then the map $A \to B_\n$ is isomorphism.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{thm:etale-over-strictly-henselian-localization-isom}
  Write $B = \colim_i B_i$ as a filtered colimit of étale $A$-algebras $B_i$. Since localization commutes with colimits, we have $B_\n = \colim_i (B_i)_{\n_i}$ where $\n_i$ is the restriction of $\n$ to $B_i$. Then use \Cref{thm:etale-over-strictly-henselian-localization-isom} to conclude each $B_i$ is isomorphic to $A$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $A$ be a ring such that every faithfully flat étale ring map $A \to B$ has
    a retraction. Then every local ring of $A$ at a maximal ideal is strictly henselian.
    \label{lemma:retractions-strictly-henselian}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be a maximal ideal of $A$, denote by $\kappa$ the residue field $\kappa(\mathfrak{m})$
    and by $\kappa^{\mathrm{sep}}$ a separable closure of $\kappa$. Let
    $A_{\mathfrak{m}} \to B \to \kappa^{\mathrm{sep}}$ be a factorisation of $A_{\mathfrak{m}} \to \kappa^{\mathrm{sep}}$
    where $A_{\mathfrak{m}} \to B$ is étale. Since $A_{\mathfrak{m}} = \colim_{f \not\in \mathfrak{m}} A_f$,
    by \ref{lemma:etale-ind-spreads} there exists $f \not\in \mathfrak{m}$ and an étale $A_f$-algebra $B'$
    such that $B = A_{\mathfrak{m}} \otimes_{A_f} B'$.
    %Denote by $\mathfrak{q}$ the kernel of
    %the composition $B' \to B \to \kappa^{\mathrm{sep}}$.
    %Then $\mathfrak{q}$ lies over $\mathfrak{m}$ in $A$.
    Because $A \to A_f \to B'$ is étale,
    there are finitely many prime ideals $\mathfrak{q}_1, \ldots, \mathfrak{q}_n$ of $B'$ lying over $\mathfrak{m}$.
    Since the kernel of the composition $B' \to B \to \kappa^{\mathrm{sep}}$ lies over $\mathfrak{m}$
    (the kernel of $A \to \kappa_{\mathrm{sep}}$ is $\mathfrak{m}$), we have $n \ge 1$.
    Set $\mathfrak{q} = \mathfrak{q}_1$. By prime avoidance, there exists $g \in B'$ such that
    $g \in \mathfrak{q}_i$ for all $i \ge 2$ and $g \not\in \mathfrak{q}$. Hence
    $\mathfrak{q}$ is the unique prime ideal of $B'_g$ lying over $\mathfrak{m}$.

    Let $U$ be the image of the induced map $\spec{B'_g} \to \spec{A}$. Since $A \to B'$ is étale, $U$ is open.
    Since $\{\mathfrak{m}\}$ is closed in $\spec{A}$, there exist $a_i$ such that
    \[
        \spec{A} - \{\mathfrak{m}\} = \bigcup_{i} D(a_i)
    .\] The complement of $U$ is closed and quasicompact, and contained in $\spec{A} - \{\mathfrak{m}\}$, hence
    there exist $a_1, \ldots, a_r$ such that
    \[
        \spec{A} = U \cup \bigcup_{i=1}^r D(a_i)
    .\] Hence the map $A \to B'_g \times \prod_{i=1}^{r} A_{a_i}$ is étale and faithfully flat. By assumption,
    it therefore has a retraction $\sigma$. Since $\mathfrak{q}$ is the unique prime ideal of $B'_g \times \prod_{i=1}^{r} A_{a_i}$
    lying over $\mathfrak{m}$, we have $\sigma^{-1}(\mathfrak{m}) = \mathfrak{q}$. In particular,
    we obtain a retraction
    \[
        B'_{\mathfrak{q}} = \left(B'_g \times \prod_{i=1}^{r} A_{a_i}\right)_{\mathfrak{q}} \to A_{\mathfrak{m}}
    \] of the map $A_{\mathfrak{m}} \to B'_{\mathfrak{q}}$. Precomposing with $B' \to B'_{\mathfrak{q}}$ we obtain
    a map $B' \to A_{\mathfrak{m}}$ and hence a map
    $B = B' \otimes_{A_f} A_{\mathfrak{m}} \to A_{\mathfrak{m}}$ that is a retraction of $A_{\mathfrak{m}} \to B$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    Let $A$ be a ring. Denote by $S(A)$ the set of finite subsets of faithfully flat étale $A$-algebras.
    We call the $A$-algebra $T(A) = \colim_{E \in S(A)} \bigotimes_{B \in E} B$ the \emph{étale precontraction} of
    $A$.

    For every faithfully flat étale ring map $A \to B$, there exists an $A$-algebra map $B \to T(A)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    $\{B\}$ is an element of $S(A)$, hence $B$ itself is part of the diagram defining $T(A)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $B = \colim_i B_i$ be a filtered colimit of (faithfully) flat $A$-algebras. Then
    $B$ is (faithfully) flat over $A$.
    \label{lemma:ind-faithfully-flat}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Because colimits commute with tensor products, ind-flat is flat. One also checks
    that pro-surjective is surjective, hence the claim.
\end{proof}

    $T(A)$ is ind-étale and faithfully flat over $A$.

\begin{proof}
    \uses{lemma:ind-faithfully-flat}
    For every $E \in S(A)$, the $A$-algebra $\bigotimes_{B \in E} B$ is étale and faithfully flat. Hence
    the result follows from the definition of ind-étale and \Cref{lemma:ind-faithfully-flat}.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    Let $A$ be a ring. Set $T^0(A) = A$ and for $n \in \N$ set $T^{n+1}(A) = T(T^n(A))$.
    We call the $A$-algebra $T^{\infty}(A) = \colim_{n \in \N} T^n(A)$
    the \emph{étale contraction of $A$}.

    and \Cref{lemma:ind-ind-etale}.

    it has a retraction.

\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}

    there exists $n \in \N$ and a faithfully flat, étale $T^n(A)$-algebra $B'$ such that
    $B = T^{\infty}(A) \otimes_{T^n(A)} B'$. By \Cref{lemma:etale-precontraction-semi-retraction},
    there exists a map $B' \to T^{n+1}(A)$. The identity of $T^{\infty}(A)$ and the composition
    $B' \to T^{n+1}(A) \to T^{\infty}(A)$ now induce a retraction
    \[
    B = T^{\infty}(A) \otimes_{T^n(A)} B' \to T^{\infty}(A)
    .\]
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}
    \uses{prop:etale-contraction-retraction, lemma:retractions-strictly-henselian}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $k$ be a field and $A$ an ind-étale, local $k$-algebra. Then $A$ is
    a separable algebraic field extension of $k$.
    \uses{def:ind-etale}
    \label{lemma:field-local-indetale}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let $A = \colim_i A_i$ such that $A_i$ is an étale $k$-algebra for all $i$.
    Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be the maximal ideal of $A$. Since localization commutes with colimits,
    we obtain $A = A_{\mathfrak{m}} = \colim_i (A_i)_{\mathfrak{m}_i}$ where
    $\mathfrak{m}_i$ is the restriction of $\mathfrak{m}$ to $A_i$. Since $A_i$ is étale over $k$,
    it is a finite product of finite separable extensions of $k$, hence $(A_i)_{\mathfrak{m}_i}$
    is a finite separable extension of $k$. Since a filtered colimit of finite separable
    extensions is an algebraic separable extension, we conclude.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
    Let $f\colon A \to B$ be ind-étale. Then $f$ induces separable algebraic extensions on residue fields.

\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    \uses{lemma:field-local-indetale}
    Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime ideal of $B$. After base change along $A \to \kappa(\mathfrak{p}^c)$,
    we may assume $A = k$ is a field. After postcomposing with the ind-étale map $B \to B_{\mathfrak{p}}$,
    we may assume $B$ is local. Hence the result follows from \ref{lemma:field-local-indetale}.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/097X}{Tag 097X}]{stacks-project}}]
    For any ring \(A\), there exists an ind-étale faithfully flat \(A\)-algebra \(B\) with \(B\) w-strictly local.

    \uses{def:w-strictly-local-ring,def:ind-etale}

\begin{proof}
    \uses{cor:strictly-henselian-etale-contraction, prop:ind-etale-residue-fields, thm:closed-points-isom-w-local,
      lemma:w-localization-closed-points, lemma:etale-contraction-ind-etale}
    By \Cref{lemma:w-localization-closed-points}, the ring $A_w$ is w-local, so the set of closed points
    of $\spec{A_w}$ is closed.
    Let $I$ be the radical ideal of $A_w$ such that $V(I)$ is the set of closed points of $\spec{A_w}$.
    Set $B' = T^{\infty}(A_w)$.
    By \Cref{cor:strictly-henselian-etale-contraction}, the local ring $B'_{\mathfrak{m}}$ is
    strictly henselian for every maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $B'$.
    The map $A_w \to B'$ induces algebraic extensions on residue fields at primes by
    \Cref{lemma:etale-contraction-ind-etale} and \Cref{prop:ind-etale-residue-fields},
    so applying \Cref{thm:closed-points-isom-w-local} to $A_w \to B'$, we obtain
    an ind-Zariski ring map $B' \to B$ such that $B'/IB' \to B/IB$ is an isomorphism,
    $V(IB)$ is the set of closed points of $\spec{B}$, $B$ is w-local
    and $A_w \to B' \to B$ is faithfully flat. Since ind-Zariski maps identify
    local rings by \Cref{thm:ind-Zariski-identifies-local-rings} and every closed point of
    $\spec{B}$ maps to a closed point of $B'$,
    the local rings at maximal ideals of $B$ are strictly Henselian. Hence $B$ is w-strictly local.

    It remains to verify that the composition $A \to A_w \to B' \to B$ is ind-étale and faithfully flat.
    This follows because both ind-étale and faithfully flat is stable under composition.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    By following all constructions, we may choose $B$
    as $((T^{\infty}(A_w))_w)_{\widetilde{V(I ((T^{\infty}(A_w))_w))}}$
    where $I$ is the radical ideal of $A_w$ defining the closed points of $A_w$.

    One may ask why $T^\infty(A)_w$ does not work. The reason for this is
    that the map $\spec{T^{\infty}(A)_w} \to \spec{T^{\infty}(A)}$ does not necessarily
    map closed points to closed points. If $A$ is already $w$-local,
    we can eliminate the points mapping to non-closed points by taking $I$ to be the ideal defining
    the closed points of $\spec{A}$.
    Then $V(I T^{\infty}(A))$ only contains closed points and by
    passing to the generalization of the preimage of $V(I T^{\infty}(A))$ in
    $\spec{T^{\infty}(A)_w}$, we obtain the desired affine scheme. If $A$ is not $w$-local,
    we may replace $A$ by $A_w$ in this process and obtain the result.

Then the map $A \to A_T$ from \Cref{def:colim-open-closed-localizations} is a surjective ind-Zariski ring map, and the induced morphism $\Spec(A_T) \to \Spec(A)$ restricts to a homeomorphism of $\Spec(A_T)$ onto the inverse image of $T$ in $X$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{thm:intersection-closed-open-iff}
  Each $A \to A_W$ is a localization at an idempotent. Passing to filtered colimits, $A \to A_T$ is surjective and ind-Zariski.

  When $T$ is closed, its inverse image $Z$ is a closed union of connected components. By \Cref{thm:intersection-closed-open-iff}, we have
  \[
    Z = \bigcap_{\substack{Z \subseteq W \\ W \text{ open and closed}}} W.

  Thus, $\Spec(A_T) = \varprojlim_W W$ is homeomorphic to $Z$ via the natural map.

  Write $T = \lim T_i$ as the limit of an inverse system of finite discrete spaces over a directed set. For each $i$ let $Z_i = \operatorname{Im} (T \to \pi_0(X) \times T_i)$. This is a closed subset. Observe that $X \times T_i$ is the spectrum of $A_i = \prod_{t \in T_i} A$ and that $A \to A_i$ is a local isomorphism. By \Cref{def:colim-open-closed-localizations,thm:colim-open-closed-localizations-surj-ind-zariski}, we see that $Z_i \subset \pi_0(X \times T_i) = \pi_0(X) \times T_i$ corresponds to a surjection $A_i \to B_i$ which is ind-Zariski such that $\Spec (B_i) = (X \times T_i) \times_{\pi_0(X) \times T_i} Z_i = X \times_{\pi_0(X)} Z_i$ as subsets of $X \times T_i$. The transition maps $T_i \to T_{i'}$ induce maps $Z_i \to Z_{i'}$ and $X \times_{\pi_0(X)} Z_i \to X \times_{\pi_0(X)} Z_{i'}$. Since the both the ring maps of \(A \to A_{i} \to B_{i}\) identifies local rings by \Cref{thm:finite-product-identifies-local-rings,thm:ind-Zariski-identifies-local-rings}, their composition also identifies local ring by \Cref{thm:identifies-local-rings-composition}. Now apply \Cref{thm:identifies-local-ring-to-top-fully-faithful}, we
  get ring maps $B_{i'} \to B_i$. 

  Set $B = \colim B_i$. Because $T = \lim Z_i$ we have $X \times_{\pi_0(X)} T = \lim X \times_{\pi_0(X)} Z_i$ and hence $Y = \Spec (B) = \lim \Spec (B_i)$ fits into the cartesian diagram
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
  Y \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & T \arrow[d] \\
  X \arrow[r] & \pi_0(X)
  \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  of topological spaces. By \Cref{thm:cartesian-profinite} we conclude that $T = \pi_0(Y)$.

  \uses{def:w-local-ring,def:extremally-disconnected,def:identify-local-rings}
  Let $A$ be a ring. If the following two conditions hold:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $A$ is w-local, and
    \item $\pi_0(\operatorname{Spec}(A))$ is extremally disconnected.
  \end{enumerate}
  Then every faithfully flat ring map $A \to B$ identifying local rings with \(B\) w-local and whose closed points of \(\Spec (B)\) are exactly \(V(IB)\) has a retraction.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

  Let $A \to B$ be faithfully flat and identifying local rings, with \(B\) w-local and whose closed points of \(\Spec (B)\) are exactly \(V(IB)\). We will show that $A \to B$ has a retraction.

  % Let $I \subset A$ be the radical ideal such that $V(I) \subset \Spec(A)$ is the set of closed points of $\Spec (A)$. We may replace $B$ by the ring $C$ constructed in \Cref{thm:closed-points-isom-w-local} for $A \to B$ and $I \subset A$. The map \(B \to C\) is faithfully flat and ind-Zariski, thus identifies local rings by \Cref{thm:ind-Zariski-identifies-local-rings}. Thus we may assume $\Spec (B)$ is w-local such that the set of closed points of $\Spec (B)$ is $V(IB)$ by \Cref{item:w-local-closed-points-isom-w-local,item:inverse-image-closed-points-isom-w-local} in \Cref{thm:closed-points-isom-w-local}.

  Choose a continuous section to the surjective continuous map $V(IB) \to V(I)$. This is possible because $V(I) = \Spec(A)^c \cong \pi_0(\Spec(A))$ (by \Cref{thm:closed-points-isom-pi0}) is extremally disconnected, see \Cref{thm:extremally-disconnected-projective}. The image is a closed subspace $T \subset \pi_0(\Spec(B)) \cong V(IB)$ (being the continuous image of the quasi-compact space $V(I)$) that maps homeomorphically onto $\pi_0(\Spec(A))$. 
  
  Let $B \to B_T$ be the ring map from \Cref{def:colim-open-closed-localizations}, which is surjective and ind-Zariski by \Cref{thm:colim-open-closed-localizations-surj-ind-zariski}. It also induces a homeomorphism $\pi_0(\Spec(B_T)) \cong T \cong \pi_0(\Spec(A))$.
  Moreover, by \Cref{thm:surjective-w-local-ring}, $B_T$ is w-local and $B \to B_T$ is w-local. Since ind-Zariski maps identify local rings (\Cref{thm:ind-Zariski-identifies-local-rings}), the composition $A \to B \to B_T$ remains w-local (\Cref{thm:w-local-map-composition}) and identifies local rings (\Cref{thm:identifies-local-rings-composition}). Therefore, by \Cref{thm:isom-of-identifies-local-rings-w-local-isom-pi0}, $A \to B_T$ is an isomorphism.

\section{w-contractible rings}

\begin{definition}[w-contractible rings, {\cite[Definition 2.4.1]{proetale}}]
A ring \(A\) is \emph{w-contractible} if every faithfully flat ind-étale map \(A \to B\) has a retraction.
  \label{def:w-contractible-ring}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{thm:w-contractible-if-ind-etale-plus-c-has-retraction}
  \uses{def:w-local-ring,def:ind-etale,def:w-contractible-ring}
  Let \(A\) be a w-local ring and $I \subset A$ the an ideal cutting out the set $X^c$ of closed points in $X = \Spec (A)$. If every faithfully flat ind-étale map \(A \to B\) with \(B\) w-local and whose closed points of \(\Spec (B)\) are exactly \(V(IB)\) has a retraction, then \(A\) is w-contractible.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{thm:closed-points-isom-w-local,thm:ind-Zariski-is-flat-ind-etale,thm:ind-etale-comp}
  Let $A \to B$ be faithfully flat and ind-étale. 
  % We will use without further mention the fact that a flat map $A \to B$ is faithfully flat if and only if every closed point of $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is in the image of $\operatorname{Spec}(B) \to \operatorname{Spec}(A)$. 
  We will show that $A \to B$ has a retraction.

  We may replace $B$ by the ring $C$ constructed in \Cref{thm:closed-points-isom-w-local} for $A \to B$ and $I \subset A$. To justify this, note that the map \(A \to C\) is faithfully flat and \(B \to C\) is ind-Zariski, thus ind-étale by \Cref{thm:ind-Zariski-is-flat-ind-etale}. Therefore, by \Cref{thm:ind-etale-comp}, the composition \( A \to C \) is also ind-étale. Hence, we may assume $\Spec (B)$ is w-local such that the set of closed points of $\Spec (B)$ is $V(IB)$ by \Cref{item:w-local-closed-points-isom-w-local,item:inverse-image-closed-points-isom-w-local} in \Cref{thm:closed-points-isom-w-local}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{thm:ind-etale-plus-c-has-retraction-if}
  \uses{def:w-strictly-local-ring,def:extremally-disconnected,def:ind-etale}
  Let $A$ be a ring. If the following two conditions hold:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $A$ is w-strictly local, and \label{item:w-strictly-local-ind-etale-plus-c-has-retraction-if}
    \item $\pi_0(\Spec (A))$ is extremally disconnected. \label{item:extremally-disconnected-ind-etale-plus-c-has-retraction-if}
  \end{enumerate}
  then every faithfully flat ind-étale map \(A \to B\) with \(B\) w-local and whose closed points of \(\Spec (B)\) are exactly \(V(IB)\) has a retraction. Here $I \subset A$ is an ideal of $A$ cutting out the set $X^c$ of closed points in $X = \Spec (A)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{thm:ind-etale-base-change,thm:ind-etale-strictly-henselian-localization-isom,thm:ff-identifies-local-rings-plus-c-has-retraction-if}
  Let \(A \to B\) be a faithfully flat ind-étale map with \(B\) w-local and such that the closed points of \(\Spec(B)\) are exactly \(V(IB)\). In this case, \(A \to B\) identifies local rings. To justify this, it suffices to check the condition at the maximal ideals of \(B\), which lie over maximal ideals of \(A\) since they map to \(V(I) = (\Spec(A))^c\). Since \(A\) is w-strictly local, the local rings of \(A\) at its maximal ideals are strictly Henselian.

  Now fix a maximal ideal \(\mathfrak{n}\) of \(B\) and let \(\mathfrak{m} = \mathfrak{n} \cap A\) be its preimage in \(A\), which is a maximal ideal. By base change to \(A_{\mathfrak{m}}\) and applying \Cref{thm:ind-etale-base-change}, we reduce to the case where \(B\) is ind-étale over a strictly Henselian local ring \(A\), with a maximal ideal \(\mathfrak{n}\) lying over the maximal ideal \(\mathfrak{m}\) of \(A\). We then want to show \(B_{\mathfrak{n}} \cong A\). This follows from \Cref{thm:ind-etale-strictly-henselian-localization-isom}.

  Having established that \(A \to B\) identifies local rings, we conclude by \Cref{thm:ff-identifies-local-rings-plus-c-has-retraction-if} that it admits a retraction.

  Choose an extremally disconnected space $T$ and a surjective continuous map $T \to \pi_0(\operatorname{Spec}(C))$ by \Cref{thm:extremally-disconnected-cover}. Note that $T$ is profinite.
  Apply \Cref{thm:exists-ind-Zariski-cartesian} to find an ind-Zariski ring map $C \to D$ such that $\pi_0(\Spec (D)) \to \pi_0(\Spec (C))$ realizes $T \to \pi_0(\Spec (C))$ and such that
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
  \operatorname{Spec}(D) \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & \pi_0(\operatorname{Spec}(D)) \arrow[d] \\
  \operatorname{Spec}(C) \arrow[r] & \pi_0(\operatorname{Spec}(C))
  \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  is cartesian in the category of topological spaces.

  Following \Cref{thm:cartesian-profinite-w-local}, we note that $\Spec (D)$ is w-local, that $\Spec (D) \to \Spec (C)$ is w-local, and that the set of closed points of $\Spec (D)$ is the inverse image of the set of closed points of $\Spec (C)$.

  Thus it is still true that the local rings of $D$ at its maximal ideals are strictly henselian (as they are isomorphic to the local rings at the corresponding maximal ideals of $C$ by \Cref{thm:ind-Zariski-identifies-local-rings}). It follows from \Cref{thm:w-contractible-if} that $D$ is w-contractible.
